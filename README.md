# storefront

Creating a storefront application with Django for practicing the Framework.
In this project I'm going to:
- Retrieve, Filtering and Annotating Objects
- Grouping Data
- Working with Expression Wrappers
- Querying Generic Relationshops
- and much more.

Inside, you can find my testing models with detailed comments
